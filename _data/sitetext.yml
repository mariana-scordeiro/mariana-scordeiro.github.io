  body: "Hi, I'm Mariana! 
  'Who am I?' you ask. Well, I'm still trying to figure that out myself, however I can tell you a bit about what's going on in my life. Professionally, I work as a Quality Assurance Engineer and, for the next 6 years, I will be taking a bachelors Degree in Software Engineering. During the weekends, I spend my time remodeling my home. In January 2021, I bought an old house just outside of the city that I am now renovating. Not alone, of course! I have help from my boyfriend and, together, we've been learning all that is to know about construction work!"
